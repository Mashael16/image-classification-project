AI project to classify fruit images using Teachable Machine and Python

learning model trained with Teachable Machine to classify fruit images as:

Fresh Apple 🍎
Rotten Apple 🍏
Fresh Banana 🍌
Rotten Banana 🍌 (rotten)
The classification is done using a Python script that loads the trained model and predicts the class of a given image.

🎯 Goal
Automatically detect whether a fruit (apple or banana) is fresh or rotten using an image.
